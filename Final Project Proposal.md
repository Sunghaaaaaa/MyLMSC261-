## Final Project Proposal


# Description of the deliverable

I will make an interactive 360% 3D visual space.
A virtual space surrounded by plain ground, it will respond to the sound that the user makes in many different textural ways.
ex) The ground shapes a liquid wave responding to the sound.
The input sound also gets modulated by a simple plugin.


# What problem does it solve?

As a musician/artist, I am used to 'presenting' my work either it is a song being streamed or a live performance. This is only a one way communication between the audience and me. That is why I wanted to try making something that I can actually interact with the audience.


# What resources will you use?

# What are the use cases?

Anyone who feels bored can use my program just for fun.


# How do you think you should be assessed?

I think I should be assessed on how much successfully did I designed my program under my precise intentions.
