# Process and Difficulties
First off, I tried to use the column function that I learned in class in order to express the specific positions of the words.
However, I failed to maintain the columns and the space while deleting the words col1, col12 and changing it into other words.
I was able to delete the first line, but as soon the ncol1 was absent, the whole code turned into a normal string with just a bunch of spaces without having the column function in it.
Therefore, I searched on Google for another way to change the lines, which was combining \ and n.
Now that I knew how to arrange the words, I just needed to insert a calculating function into the string so that it executes the result when I press enter.
I set x as 1 + 1 + 1.
Next, I put x as a function, not the alphabet into the string.
# Further goal I want to achieve
It would be very nice If I could set a single word or letter that implies the entire code that I created so that for example, if I just did print("a"), it would give me the exact result.
