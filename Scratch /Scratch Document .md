## Steps I went through
1. I searched for the sprites that I liked.
2. I wanted my system work with minimum physical orders so I set up the whole
animation to be done by just pressing the space bar.
3. I held up the divers for 1.2 seconds before their action to look like they are
dancing after the magic activated.
4. I added sound effects to the wand.
5. Finally, I added the background music through the dinosaur sprite.
