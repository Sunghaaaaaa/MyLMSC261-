## Bandsite Documentation

 I was having a very hard time figuring out how all the Github branching works.
 Thanks to my classmates' help, I was able to clone Dom's repository in order to push my edits with my github desktop.
I have very little contribution to this project.
The group members were very enthusiastic on the project and helpful whenever I had problems that I didn't know how to solve which was mostly about the branching and pushing works.
