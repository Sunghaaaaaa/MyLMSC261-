## Github Troll


# I searched some projects or codes related to 3d modeling
for my final project.

One of the projects using 'hydra' was introduced by my professor.
I also found another tool which is an API called WebGL.
I couldn't discover any specific changes that were done
during the project, but both of the repositories were very helpful to my project.
Now I have to choose which one will I use.
